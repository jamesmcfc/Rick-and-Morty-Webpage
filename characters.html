    <p>Richard "Rick" D. Sanchez, simply known as Rick Sanchez or just Rick (Earth Rick Sanchez C-137 to other Ricks) is one of the titular main protagonists of the science fiction adult animated comedy series Rick and Morty. He is the grandfather of Morty Smith and Summer Smith, ex-husband of Diane Sanchez, father of Beth Sanchez-Smith and father-in-law of Jerry Smith.</p>
    <p>Although Rick is one of the main protagonists and a loving father and grandfather, he is an extremely immoral, reckless and nihilistic alcoholic genius who constantly places his family in dangerous situations while looking down on others, especially his son-in-law. He is a parody of Doc Brown from Back to the Future, Bert from Sesame Street and the Doctor from Doctor Who.</p>
    <p>He is voiced by Justin Roiland, who voiced Earl of Lemongrab in Adventure Time and Blendin Blandin in Gravity Falls.</p><br><br><br>

    <p>Currently, Morty is around 14 years old. He first met his grandfather, Rick Sanchez, when the latter moved into his home after supposedly being absent for 20 years. However, it was revealed that Rick is originally from Dimension C-137 and, after losing his wife and daughter, eventually moved into Morty's dimension to live with an adult version of Beth. However, curiously enough, it has been shown Rick knew Morty when he was a baby.</p><br><br><br>

    <p>She currently acts as the older sister and the granddaughter of the Morty and Rick, respectively, from the Cronenberged Dimension and Dimension C-137. She is the only other known member of the the Smith Family to be aware of that fact.[1] As the series has progressed, Summer has become more frequently involved in Rick and Morty's adventures. She and Morty often squabble for Rick's affection, but also maintain a unique bond stemming from the revelation that Morty is not her original brother.</p><br><br><br>

    <p>Birdperson, briefly also known as Phoenixperson, is a friend of Rick Sanchez. He has known Rick for a long time, and has seemingly known Morty since he was a baby, as revealed in the episode "Get Schwifty". In the finale of Season 4, his cyborg form was dismantled and in Rick's possession before he was finally restored to his original form in "Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort".</p>
